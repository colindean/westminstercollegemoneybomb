# Westminster College Moneybomb

WCMB started in 2012 as a way for me to experiment with the [moneybomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneybomb) strategy of fundraising using free and nearly free services to achieve a single-day donation record for [Westminster College](https://westminster.edu), my undergraduate alma mater. I achieved that single-day donation record in 2012 and I believe I beat it in 2013. The effort was dormant 2014-2017 but returned in 2018. 

In 2019, the effort shifted from being an active campaign reset each year to being a yearly reminder to donate. The date also moved from the final day of the institution's financial year - June 30 - to [Giving Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_Tuesday), the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving.

I'm always looking for help remembering to do this since some parts are still manual and I'd love to pass it off to an alum who is as enthusiastic about fundraising for Mother Fair as I am.
