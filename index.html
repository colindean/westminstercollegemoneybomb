			<h3 class="nudge">We Need Your Participation</h3>
			<p>Organizations can always use more money, but what Westminster College needs is your <em>participation</em>. Given the national average of 9%, as of 2013, Westminster already has an above average rate of alumni participation: more than 26% of alumni gave <em>something</em> in the last year, even $1.</p>
			<p>Having greater participation means that Westminster gets access to better grants and better programs, so students, faculty, and staff can reap the benefits and improve the mission of Westminster College.</p>
		  <h4>Did you know?</h4>
		  <ul class="square">
		    <li>A student's tuition covers only 70% of the cost of their education.</li>
		    <li>Donations from alumni and friends, as well as grants, cover the much of the remaining 30%.</li>
		    <li>No tuition money is used for capital improvements.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <div class="show-full">
		    <h4>Aid others</h4>
		    <p>If you received financial aid, more than likely alumni funded that assistance. Why not pay it forward?</p>

		    <h4>What is a money bomb?</h4>
		    <p>A money bomb is a united effort among supporters of a cause to donate simultaneously on a single day.</p>
		    <p>Money bombs like this one have raised millions of dollars in a single day for political candidates, so why not try to raise thousands of dollars for our alma mater?</p>
		    <p>See also the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneybomb">money bomb -&gt;</a></p>
        <h4>Why December 3, 2019?</h4>
        <p>It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_Tuesday">Giving Tuesday</a>! We use to do this at the end of June, but college giving folks said they prefer December gifts to June.
